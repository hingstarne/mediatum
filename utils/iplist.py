"""
This module converts ip address lists into ipaddr Network objects,
which in turn can be fed into mediatum for access control.
Lists may consist of strings of the form "12.12.12.12-12.12.12.34/32".
Common usage pattern is to parse a list with ipranges_to_ipobjects,
followed by update_mediatum_iplist to store the list in the database.
"""


# Terminology here:
#  * ipobject : something like ipaddr.IPAddress or ipaddr.IPNetwork
#  * iprange : a string that represents a range of ip addresses
#  * oldiplist : a dictionary containing many ip address ranges;
#                this was used in the old mysql world in tumips.py
